<p>I have over 25 years of work experience in software development and engineering. I recently moved to the United States from China to pursue new opportunities.

<p>Some of my accomplishments include:</p>

 <li>Building CI/CD pipelines for startup teams</li>
</ul>

<p>I practice DevOps skills daily by creating a project that uses Terraform and Ansible scripts to request and release various cloud resources, such as hosts, networks, domains, etc. 
It also sets up CI/CD pipelines and various infrastructures for logging, monitoring, and tracing. This improves my skills and reduces costs.</p>
